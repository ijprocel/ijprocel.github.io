    <h1 id="title">The STAR method: the perfect way to answer interview questions</h1>
    <div id="articleBody">
        <p>
            We've all been there before: sitting in an interview, knowing we have just the right anecdote for the question
            at hand, but unable to organize our thoughts. The key to avoid getting tongue-tied is to have a powerful, readily-adaptable
            framework at hand for turning memories, experiences, and emotions into a well-crafted narrative: the STAR method.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what exactly <i>is</i> the STAR method? STAR stands for:
            <ul>
                <li><b>S</b>ituation</li>
                <li><b>T</b>ask</li>
                <li><b>A</b>ction</li>
                <li><b>R</b>esult</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>When formulating a response to an interview question, you should start with the: </p>

        <h3>Situation</h3>
        <p>
            You should begin by giving the background information needed to understand your contribution. Think big picture. Give
            your interviewer a sense of what challenges your group or organization was facing, what was at stake if the situation
            took a turn for the worse and what you stood to gain from resolving the situation successfully.
        </p>

        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p>
            Whereas the goal when describing the <b>situation</b> was to give a sense of the big picture, now it's time to get more
            specific. What exactly was your part in the situation at hand? How was that determined? Did you take the initiative when
            deciding what to do next?
        </p>

        <h3>Action</h3>
        <p>
            You've described what your <b>task</b> was, now get more specific: How did you carry it out? Did unexpected problems crop
            up, forcing you to think on your feet? What kinds of skills did you demonstrate when carrying out your task.
        </p>

        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>
            The interviewer now knows what happened before and during, but what happened after? If things went very well, how did
            those around you benefit from your actions? If they didn't go so well, what valuable lessons did you take away from the
            experience?
