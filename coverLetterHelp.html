    <h1>Cover Letter Checklist</h1>
    <div id="articleBody">
        <p>
            Writing a cover letter can be a daunting, but potentially rewarding, exercise. A cover letter gives you the opportunity
            to flesh yourself out for an employer, beyond a resume. You can show off your written communication skills, give some hints
            about your personality, and really emphasize your best qualities. You can find some wonderful, more comprehensive guides out there,
            but this is meant to be a quick, easily-digestible checklist that you can quickly review!

        <p>
            We'll start with the...
        </p>

        <h3>Heading</h3>
        <p>
            First on the page should be your contact info: name, address, phone number, and email. Then, skip a line and write today's date.
            The next part can be tricky: if possible, you should find out who the hiring manager for the position is and address the letter to them.
            If you've successfully identified this person, list <i>their</i> contact information next: name, office address, phone number, and email.
            If you're not sure who the hiring manager is, some sources recommend addressing the letter to a senior HR manager in the company, while others
            recommend skipping this altogether.
        </p>

        <h3>Salutation</h3>
        <p>
            If you've identified a recipient, begin your letter with <i>"Dear Ms./Mr. Lastname"</i>. If you haven't, use a salutation that is
            generic, but as specific as possible (<i>Dear (CompanyName) Software Development Hiring Manager</i>, as opposed to <i>Dear Hiring Manager</i>).
        </p>
        <p>
            End your salutation with a comma and skip a line.
        </p>

        <h3>Length</h3>
        <p>
            While writing, keep in mind that your cover letter should fit on one page and be a quick read. 250-400 words is a good length.
        </p>

        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of an introduction is to grab the reader's attention. Resist the urge to begin with <i>
                "I'm writing this letter to express my interest
                in the position of..."
            </i>. Try some of <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/cover-letter-openers/">these</a> strategies instead.
        </p>

        <h3>Main Body</h3>
        <p>
            Your goal when writing the main body of your cover letter is to talk about your strengths and achievements <b>in a way that is tailored
                to the employer and position</b>.
            In his famous book <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>, Dale Carnegie reminds us to always talk in terms of the 
            other person's interests. When you write the main body of your cover letter, don't just brag about <b>you</b>rself or talk about what
            <b>you</b> want from the potential employer. Talk about what you can do for them.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Now it's time to wrap things up. Express a desire to further discuss your mutual interests with the reader and thank them for taking the
            time to review your letter. Sign the letter:
            
            <i><p>Sincerely,</p>
            
            <p>Your Name</p></i>
        </p>
